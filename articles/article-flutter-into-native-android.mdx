# Integrating Flutter into a Native Android App (Kotlin) with Git Submodule

In a recent project, I integrated a Flutter module into an existing Android app written in Kotlin. Instead of rewriting the app or creating a monolithic hybrid, the goal was to embed Flutter in specific parts of the native app for rapid UI development and cross-platform support. In this article, I’ll walk through how we structured the integration, shared data like tokens and headers, and maintained a consistent theme between native and Flutter layers.

## Project Structure and Approach

We decided to create the Flutter module as a **separate project** and included it in the main Android app as a **Git submodule**. This separation allowed:

- Independent development and testing of the Flutter module.
- Reusability of the Flutter module in other projects.
- Cleaner version control and collaboration between native and Flutter developers.

### Directory Structure (Simplified)

```
/native-android-app
  /app
  /flutter-module (Git submodule)
```

## Adding Flutter to the Native App

### 1. Creating the Flutter Module

We generated the Flutter module using:

```bash
flutter create --template module flutter_module
```

This created the `flutter_module` directory which we then pushed to a separate Git repo and added back to the main project as a submodule:

```bash
git submodule add https://github.com/your-org/flutter_module.git flutter-module
```

### 2. Integrating Flutter in Android Project

We included the Flutter module in the native project’s `settings.gradle`:

```
setBinding(new Binding([gradle: this]))
evaluate(new File(
  settingsDir.parentFile,
  'flutter-module/.android/include_flutter.groovy'
))
```

Then, in `app/build.gradle`:

```
implementation project(':flutter')
```

### 3. Initializing Flutter Engine

To preload the Flutter engine and avoid delays during navigation, we initialized it in the `Application` class:

```
class MyApplication : Application() {
    lateinit var flutterEngine: FlutterEngine

    override fun onCreate() {
        super.onCreate()

        flutterEngine = FlutterEngine(this).apply {
            dartExecutor.executeDartEntrypoint(
                DartExecutor.DartEntrypoint.createDefault()
            )
        }

        FlutterEngineCache
            .getInstance()
            .put("my_engine_id", flutterEngine)
    }
}
```

### 4. Setting Up Platform Channel Communication

To handle token passing and other shared data, we used a `MethodChannel`.  Make sure to set up and initialise along with engine

**Native Side (Kotlin):**

```
MethodChannel(flutterEngine.dartExecutor.binaryMessenger, "app.channel.shared.data")
    .setMethodCallHandler { call, result ->
        when (call.method) {
            "getToken" -> {
                val token = getTokenFromNativeStorage()
                result.success(token)
            }
            else -> result.notImplemented()
        }
    }
```

**Flutter Side (Dart):**

```
const platform = MethodChannel('app.channel.shared.data');

Future<String?> getToken() async {
  try {
    final String? token = await platform.invokeMethod('getToken');
    return token;
  } catch (e) {
    print("Failed to get token: $e");
    return null;
  }
}
```

### 5. Theme Synchronization

To keep theming consistent between native and Flutter, we passed theme data via initial route arguments or platform channel, and used `ThemeData` in Flutter to match the native app’s color scheme and typography.

```
final themeData = ThemeData(
  primaryColor: Color(0xFF6200EE), // match native theme
  fontFamily: 'Roboto',
);
```

## Conclusion

This modular approach made it easier to integrate Flutter into an existing Android app with minimal disruption. Using a Git submodule allows us to keep the Flutter codebase decoupled yet synchronized, while platform channels help bridge native and Dart logic seamlessly.

If you're considering adding Flutter to a native app, this strategy strikes a good balance between maintainability and performance.
